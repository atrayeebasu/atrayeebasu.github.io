I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale School of Medicine, working with [Dr. Stephen Strittmatter](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/stephen-strittmatter/). I did my PhD from [National Brain Research Center (NBRC)](https://anindyaghoshroy.weebly.com/), Manesar, India, supervised by [Dr. Anindya Ghosh Roy](https://anindyaghoshroy.weebly.com/). My primary research interests involve investigating whether axonal regeneration following injury in adulthood leads to functional recovery in [_Caenorhabditis elegans_](http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_celegansintro/celegansintro.html). In my PhD thesis I have also addressed the molecular and cellular basis of functional recovery, using mechanosensory neuron involving touch sensation as the model. Specifically, we showed that a self-fusion mechanism between the neuronâ€™s severed proximal and distal part during regeneration leads to a quick functional repair and this phenomenon is regulated by a [highly conserved miRNA let-7](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/47/E10206).

In another line of research I investigate the effect of DAF-16/ FOXO transcription factor in Insulin/IIS signalling, which regulates the guidance of the regrowing axon towards its proper postsynaptic target in both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous manner.

I am also highly interested to further explore neural regeneration in higher models involving vertebrates such as mouse. You can find [my detailed CV here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf). I am a recipient of the [Inspiring Science Award, 2019](https://www.facebook.com/TNQTechnologies/posts/congratulations-again-to-all-the-finalists-of-the-inspiring-science-award-2019-t/2074795909224945/) from TNQ, India.
My research has been featured in [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nbrc-researchers-discover-functional-recovery-mechanism-after-neuronal-injury/article20443364.ece), one of the leading English newspapers in India. Other than research, I am a professional Indian Classical dancer (Bharatnatyam), and love painting and composing music.
